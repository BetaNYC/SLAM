# SLAM
SLA Mapper (SLAM) â€“ is a tool that aggregates data that community boards often have to gather in order to review liquor license applications and sidewalk cafe applications. Displaying this information in a unified view saves community boards considerable time and resources.

## File an Issue 
We're tracking all issues via this [repo's issue cue](https://github.com/BetaNYC/SLAM/issues).

## Architecture
SLAM is a landing page that displays a Carto basemap and markers for each row of four datasets stored in BetaNYC's Carto account (1) 311 complaints about a club/restaurant/bar since 2017, 2) active SLA licenses, 3) sidewalk cafe licenses, and 4) the location of restaurant inspections). Clicking on a marker further queries the datasets stored in Carto for additional information about the complaint/license/inspection. Searching for a NYC location queries the City's GeoClient API for the geo-coordinates that correspond to the entered address, and the map repositions to this location.
