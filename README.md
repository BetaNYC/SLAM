# SLAM
SLA Mapper ([SLAM](slam.beta.nyc)) â€“ is a tool that aggregates data that community boards often have to gather in order to review liquor license applications and sidewalk cafe applications. Displaying this information in a unified view saves community boards considerable time and resources.

## Architecture
SLAM is a landing page that displays a Carto basemap and markers for each row of four datasets stored in BetaNYC's Carto account (1) 311 complaints about a club/restaurant/bar since 2017, 2) active SLA licenses, 3) sidewalk cafe licenses, and 4) the location of restaurant inspections). Clicking on a marker further queries the datasets stored in Carto for additional information about the complaint/license/inspection. Searching for a NYC location queries the City's GeoClient API for the geo-coordinates that correspond to the entered address, and the map repositions to this location. 

## Backend Services
### Carto.js v4

* [Documentation](https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/reference/)

### Leaflet.js

* [Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.2.html)

### Chart.js
We use Chart.js to display a pie chart depicting the breakdown of 311 complaints made about a particular club/bar/restaurant according to their descriptors and a line chart depicting the number of 311 complaints made per year at a particular club/bar/restaurant.

### NYC Geoclient API
We use the City's Geoclient API for two tasks. First, when users enter a text address into the location search field, the system queries the Geoclient API for the lat/lon of that location. The map re-centers to this lat/lon.  Second, when a user clicks on a liquor license, the system queries the Geoclient API for the Building Identification Number (BIN) of the address listed for that liquor license. Having the establishment's BIN, we can construct a URL to the Certificate of Occupancy of the building, hosted on the DOB's website.

### carto
Most of the data for SLAM is stored in BetaNYC's carto account.
* `liquor_authority_quarterly_list_of_active_licenses`
  * Dataset of all NYS active liquor licenses
  * [Published](https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Liquor-Authority-Quarterly-List-of-Active-Licenses/hrvs-fxs2) by the State Liquor Authority on NYS's Open Data Portal 
  * Data is updated in the Open Data Portal quarterly and synced with BetaNYC's Carto account monthly.
* `club_bar_restaurant_complaints_since_jan_1_2017`
  * Dataset of all NYC 311 complaints made about a club/restaurant/bar since 2017
  * [Published](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Club-Bar-Restaurant-Complaints-Since-Jan-1-2017/ezmw-ux9w) as a BetaNYC-filtered view on NYC's Open Data Portal 
  * Data is updated daily and synced wtih BetaNYC's Carto account daily. 
* `sidewalk_caf_licenses_and_applications`
  * Dataset of all current, pending, and expired sidewalk cafe licenses in NYC
  * [Published](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Sidewalk-Caf-Licenses-and-Applications/qcdj-rwhu/data) by the Department of Consumer Affairs on NYC's Open Data Portal 
  * Data is updated weekly and synced wtih BetaNYC's Carto account weekly. 
* `dohmh_inspections`
  * Dataset of locations of NYC inspected restaurants
  * Health grades for a NYC restaurant can be found in the Department and Health and Mental Hygiene's [Restaurant Inspection Results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/data) dataset, published on the City's Open Data Portal. This dataset is organized so that each row represents one violation raised during a restaurant's health inspection. The row also reports the date of the inspection and the resulting grade. If restaurants had more than one violation during the inspection, there will be multiple rows representing that particular inspection, each reporting different violations but all reporting the same grade. If a restaurant has had more than one inspection, there will be multiple rows representing the restaurant's violations and grades given on different inspection dates. When the page loads, however, we do not need to display all of this information. In fact, the dataset is so large that we can't display all of that information on the page load. We only need to display the location of a restaurant that has been inspected. Later a user can click on the restaurant to trigger a query to gather more information about the restaurant's inspection history. 
  * The DOHMH inspection restults dataset does not include geo-coordinates - only a building number, street name, and zip code. To get the locations in a format where they can be displayed on a map, we need to download the dataset and use the City's [Batch GeoSupport](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-gde-home.page) software to get the geo-coordinates. Since the same restaurants are often listed many times in the DOHMH inspection results dataset, to reduce processing time, we first remove rows representing the same restaurant from the dataset using R or Excel. We configure the GeoSupport software to read the filtered dataset and return the restaurant's name, unique identifier, address, lat, and lon. 
  * Data is downloaded from Socrata, geo-coded, and manually uplaoded to Carto weekly. 
* `dohmh_new_york_city_restaurant_inspection_results`
  * Dataset of NYC restaurant inspection results
  * [Published](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/data) by the Department of Health and Mental Hyegine on NYC's Open Data Portal 
  * Data is updated weekly and synced with BetaNYC's Carto account weekly
  * This dataset is only referenced once a user clicks on a resturant on the map. The query reads the unique identifier for the clicked on restaurant and then queries the restaurant inspection results dataset to get the inspection, violation, and grade history for the restaurant.
